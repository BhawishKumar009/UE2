How do you feel about meeting new people, seeing a new teacher, and exploring new academic topics? Do you feel anxious or excited?

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

If you have the slightest feeling of any of the fears, it is better to discuss them openly and look for solutions.

# Habits Of Mind…

Academic writing requires not only writing skills, but 

![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) also exploration, thinking and an audacious mindset; after that, you should feel 'I have succeeded'! The goal of this coursebook is to make you aware of the importance of conveying clear and lucid ideas that interest the reader. University English II achieves this through helping you learn about the current and evolving concepts that shape our society.

Let's explore the three gateways using the 6E framework.

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

## Theoretical Literature Review In Ueii?

A theoretical literature review provides an *overview of* 

![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png) current knowledge, *shares with the reader the results of* other studies, or provides a framework for *explaining the* importance of your essay or project. In University English II, a literature review is a piece of writing that allows you to examine Concepts of Change and theories, which set the context for discussing their effects on your discipline.

'Conduct your research' in this course means conducting research into Concepts of Change.

![9_image_2.png](9_image_2.png)

Gateway 1

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)

Human Intelligence in the Future World A Gateway introduces you to a series of readings, ideas and issues. This Gateway includes topics such as the nature of post-humanism, intelligence, and *cyborgs*. A significant part of university education, and what your teachers do in your department and faculty, is exploring the yet-to-be-fully-understood aspects of the world. 

Your teacher will only be able to guide you through a portion of these readings. You should not expect to receive all the explanations through the classroom activities. You may feel anxious when exploring a new topic, and we guarantee that this is normal.

Before you begin the tasks, you can FASTFORWARD to the EPILOGUE to have a glimpse at suggested writing topics.

 Attitude towards academic writing: This UEII student, Marcus, has stumbled onto 

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)

a somewhat exciting essay topic, Transhumanism. What is this topic about?

Suppose you are interested in the topic 'transhumanism' after reading the previous text, and you used ChatGPT to find out what it is. Here you have the answers. So what does ChatGPT tell you?

What are transhumanist theories in simple words?

Transhumanist theories are a set of ideas and beliefs that focus on using technology to enhance and improve human capabilities. The term
"transhumanism" refers to the idea of transcending or going beyond what is considered the normal human condition.

Transhumanists believe in the potential for technological advancements to enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. They advocate for the use of technologies like genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and biomedical enhancements to overcome the limitations of the human body and mind.

The goal of transhumanism is to improve human life and achieve a "posthuman" state, where humans have augmented capabilities that ss increased intelligence, extended lifespans, enhanced physical strength, and even the ability to merge with machines or upload consciousness.

In simple terms, transhumanist theories are about using technology to enhance human abilities and potentially achieve a state of being that goes beyond what is currently considered "normal" for humans. 10 Like SI Dislike

What are posthumanist theories in simple words?

Posthumanist theories are a set of ideas and perspectives that challenge traditional notions of what it means to be human. They explore the ways in which technology, culture, and other factors shape our understanding of human identity and relationships with the world.

Posthumanist theories question the idea that humans are separate and ssss interconnectedness of humans with animals, nature, and even machines. These theories encourage us to reconsider the boundaries between humans and non-humans, and to think about how our identities are shaped by social and cultural influences. Posthumanism also explores the potential for new forms of existence, such as cyborgs (part-human, part-machine beings) or artificial intelligence. It raises important ethical questions about the impact of these advancements on individuals and society.

In simple terms, posthumanist theories challenge traditional views of human nature and invite us to think more broadly about what it means to be human in a rapidly changing world.

Rather than improving our lives, science and technology today increasingly leave us debilitated and infantilised. It is time to restrain the runaway ambitions of technoscientific knowledge.

The idea of a 'cyborg' replaces the traditional views by Descartes about mind and body separation (Muri, 2007, p. 6). 

Technology blurs this distinction by integrating with both our physical bodies and our thinking processes. One example is the field of neuromorphic computing.

| While medical implants improve innate capabilities  to overcome illnesses, non-medical implants also  enhance innate capabilities, but they do not aim to  cure medical problems. Importantly, both types of  implants do not change a person's mental state,  consciousness, or perception; they simply boost  their inherent capabilities (Park 2014; Lai 2012;  Buchanan-Oliver and Cruz 2011; Christie and  Bloustien 2010). This raises a crucial question of  whether the cyborg evolution might redefine our  understanding of human medical anomalies and  therefore reshape drastically our societal norms of  human boundaries. | medical  implants Medical  anomalies |

intelligence (AI) and cyborgs transforms the human body into an information processing technology and turns it more computational and informatised. 

This revolution undermines the absolute human identity and enabling the vision of hybrid creatures, consisting of human and technological components at one.

optimistic Some well-known scientists worry about robots replacing humans, potentially causing massive unemployment. However, these concerns overlook the potential for humans to become superior cyborgs through body-enhancing technologies. 

Cyborgs could include individuals with massproduced implants, body hacks, or custom insideables.

 Let's read the example literature review and use the rubrics to understand it.

Activity 1.6 The purpose of this Literature review is to discuss the controversies surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it concludes with the author's opinions. AI is becoming a buzzword in many contexts around the world, in particular, in schools and higher institutions, where teaching and learning are increasingly digitized (Dator, 2020; Köstler & Ossewaarde, 2021). At the same time, the question of how AI intertwines with creativity is emerging (e.g., Rust & Huang, 2021). Here is a brief introduction to the background according to my review.

The field of AI has evolved from a small research project at Dartmouth College (US) in the 1950s to recent advances. As Creely (2022) outlined, AI has been applied to a dozen industries, including big data analytics, speech and facial recognition (e.g., Siri), and robotics, among others. Advances in machine learning and deep learning have facilitated AI's creative contributions to all aspects of life (Boden, 2018; Mitchell, 2019; Verma et al., 2021; Yi & Loia, 2019). However, neither being new nor effective alone is sufficient for AI to be referred to as intelligent. A compelling example is given by Cropley et al. (2022, p. 22), who illustrate this with an example: solving a parking issue by parking on the moon is novel but impractical. A creative product is novel, effective, and based on one's understanding of the world. According to Cropley et al., a product is creative when it is both novel and effective, and design must be based on one's knowledge of the world and sensibilities.

## Controversies Surrounding Artificial Intelligence

AI approaches, while innovative, are not exempt from ethical controversies. At the heart of these arguments lies a critical question - will super AI systems ever take over human intelligence (Peeters et al., 2021). I would like to introduce two prominent threads that underlie this debate. The first paragraph discusses the human-centric perspective of intelligence and creativity, and the next paragraph focuses on how AI creativity overturns our conception of consciousness. The first is about using the term 'intelligence' which is often used to frame the scope of AI innovation. In general, intelligence is the ability to successfully engage in the world, adapt to new situations, and solve theoretical and practical problems (Schlinger, 2003; Staats & Burns, 1981). There are three types of intelligence, according to Sternberg et al (2008): analytical, practical, and creative. Sternberg's theory emphasizes that intelligence is made up of humans' ability to perceive the world through senses and sensibilities. However, with AI, there is an underlying assumption that creativity is limited to computation and less emphasis on touchy perception. This view results in a narrow conception of creativity. The idea of AI creativity is challenged when the notion of consciousness comes into the picture. Consciousness, a topic debated across many disciplines, including brain science, and even ancient philosophers (Sattin et al., 2021), is hard to define or understand, despite its being present in biological beings, and particularly humans with larger brains (Shear, 1997). The aim of AI, particularly strong or super AI, is to create an independent, non-biological intelligence that incorporates consciousness. However, achieving this, especially without a clear understanding or agreed definition of consciousness, seems quite difficult (Li et al., 2021). The literature reviewed questions what remains of intelligence when it is intelligence without consciousness.

## Yet, More Problems Are Waiting To Be Solved

An important quote from Harari (2017, p. 251) states: 
"Until today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence".

Adapted from Creely Creely, E. (2022). Conceiving creativity and learning in a world of artificial intelligence: A thinking model. In D. 

Henriksen & P. Mishra (Eds.), Creative provocations: Speculations on the future of creativity, technology & 
learning (pp. 35-50). Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14549-0 This perspective is at odds with the new definitions of "creativity" and "consciousness" outlined above that AI creativity underpins. According to Tegmark (2017), this is Life 3.0, where non-biological intelligent life can think, create and be fully autonomous, existing on an equivalent level with biological life. By revisiting these notions, my literature review has led to a better understanding of how AI intelligence differs from our traditional understanding of intelligence. However, there is also a risk of disruption to what is considered to be a 'normal' learning process: As AI becomes more humanlike, teachers' role in influencing student creativity may shift as the machine becomes creative (see, Creely, 2022), and this could subvert the usual role of a teacher.

Using the rubrics to understand the Literature Review

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

Since a real literature review is not an assignment, it is not normally graded. Nevertheless, we will apply the Literature review draft assessment rubrics (Full mark: 100; A: 85/100) and understand how they function. In the following, use different parts of the rubrics to evaluate each paragraph.

Discuss with your classmates the effectiveness of each paragraph.

The purpose of this Literature review discuss the is to controversies surrounding Artificial Intelligence (ÁI) and it concludes with the author's opinions.

AI is becoming a buzzword in many contexts arofind the world, in particular, in schools and higher institutions/where teaching and learning are increasingly digitized (Dator, 2020; Köstler & Ossewaarde, 2021). At the same time, the question of how AI intertwines with creativity is emerging (e.g., Rust & Huang, 2021). Here is a brief introduction to the background according to my review.

## Teacher'S Comment:

As a reader, I am informed of the purpose.     Also,    
 I
aree that AI is becoming a buzzword. This idea resonates with mine.

Teacher's comment:
The generalisations and examples help me understand AI
as a field. 

 As readers, we learn something new as we read on.

Teacher's comment:
As readers, we feel that there ademic evaluation of the readings.  Adjectives and     coordinating conjunctions
'neither…nor' indicate       attitude and critical thinking.       Jargon terms are explained through an interesting example.

## Controversies Surrounding Artificial Intelligence,

![32_Image_2.Png](32_Image_2.Png)

AI approaches, while innovative, are not exempt from ethical controversies. At the heart of these arguments lies a critical question –
will super AI systems ever take over human intelligence (Peeters et al., 21). I would like to introduce two prominent threads that underlie this debate. The first paragraph discusses the human-centric perspective of intelligence and creativity, and the next paragraph focuses on how AI creativity overturns our conception of consciousness.

use The The of subheadings introduces themes focuses and discussion.

The writer presents his arguments in a way that leads us to understand       
the literature a systematic way.

Teacher's comment:
The first is about using the term 'intelligence' which is often used to frame the scope of AI innovation. In general, intelligence is the ability to successfully engage in the world, adapt to new situations, and solve theoretical and practical problems
(Schlinger, 2003; Staats & Burns, 1981). There are three types of intelligence, according to Sternberg et al. (2008): analytical, practical, and creative. Sternberg's theory emphasizes that intelligence is made up of humans' ability to perceive the world through senses and sensibilities. However, with AI, there is an underlying assumption that creativity is limited to computation and less emphasis on touchy perception. This view results in a nrrow conception of creativity.

The first 'what'? A bit unclear here. In general, the writer uses adjectives, nns, and noun phrases carefully.

There are a variety of sentence structures: declarative clauses (here is/are),

complex, embedded sentences (while) and parallel structures (to engage...adapt...

What is your comment?

The idea of AI creativity is challenged when the notion of consciousness comes into the picture. Consciousness, a topic debated across many disciplines, including brain science, and even ancient philosophers (Sattin et al., 2021), is hard to define or understand, despite its being present in biological beings, and particularly humans with larger brains (Shear, 1997). The aim of AI, particularly strong or super AI, is to create an independent, non-biological intelligence that incorporates consciousness. However, achieving this, especially without a clear understanding or agreed definition of consciousness, seems quite difficult (Li et al., 2021). The literature reviewed questions what remains of intelligence when it is intelligence without consciousness.

## Yet, More Problems Are Waiting To Be Solved

An important quote from Harari (2017, p. 251) states:
"Until today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence".

This perspective is at odds with the new definitions of
"creativity" and "consciousness" outlined above that AI
creativity underpins. According to Tegmark (2017), this is Life 3.0, where non-biological intelligent life can think, create and be fully autonomous, existing on an equivalent level with biological life.

8 By revisiting these notions, my literature review has led to a better understanding of how AI intelligence differs from our traditional understanding of intelligence. However, there is also a risk of disruption to what is considered to be a 'normal' learning process: As AI becomes more human-like, teachers' role in influencing student creativity may shift as the machine becomes creative (see, Creely, 2022), and this could subvert the usual role of a teacher.

The next part of this review will move onto how intelligent machines impact my research area, Physical Activity and Sports.

The Thesis Statement is written in a more definitive and *critical tone*. In a literature review, the tone does not need to be that strong.

Suggestions:
- Use 'examine the claim that' or 'explore the theory that' to focus on the process and the unknown outcome.

- *Delete language that suggests causation*, e.g., 'ultimately' and 'thus'

Teacher's comment:
The Thesis Statement is written in a more definitive tone. In a literature review, the tone does not need to be that strong.

Suggestions:
- Use 'aims to explore' to focus on the process. Use 'regarding the way in which' to focus on the process but not the outcome.

- *Delete language that suggests causation*, e.g., 'as' This literature review This essay argues that the roles of user agency and responsibility, complexity of mental health factors, and individual user differences make it unreasonable to hold social media platforms accountable for mental health issues experienced by 

| users.   |

Ask your partner to evaluate your revised sentences:
Where do *you include your purpose?*
- The beginning paragraph should include your *purpose statement*.

- Appropriate headings and subheadings are needed to orientate the reader.

 *Improving the writing of a paragraph:* Writing can never be 'too perfect'. This 

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

paragraph is drawn from the literature review you already read. Read it again. Discuss with your classmates how you want to improve the writing.

Activity 1.8 When writing a literature review, explain something because the readers need to know it, not because you want to. Keep in mind that your writing can always be *further refined*.

Am I too self-centred in saying my review has 'led to a better understanding'?

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

By revisiting these notions, my literature review has led to a better understanding of how AI 
intelligence differ from our traditional understanding of intelligence. However, there is also a risk of disruption to what is considered to be a 'normal' learning process: As AI becomes more human-like, teachers' role in influencing student creativity may shift as the machine becomes creative (see, Creely, 2022), and this could further subvert the usual role of a teacher. 

The next part of this review will move onto how intelligent machines impact my research area, Physical Activity and Sports.

![6_image_2.png](6_image_2.png)

Is there a missing 's'?

The last paragraph is further refined: By revisiting these definitions, my literature review has contributed to a more fine-grained led to a better understanding of how AI intelligence differ from our traditional conception understanding of intelligence. However, The wider implication of this discussion is that there is also a risk of disruption to what is considered to be a 'normal' learning process: As AI becomes more human-like, teachers' role in influencing student creativity may shift as the machine becomes creative (see, Creely, 2022), and this development could further subvert the usual role of a teacher.

Sharpen the focus What do the words 'contributed to a more fine-grained understanding', 
'the wider implication' imply?

Why do we need to add 
'development'?

## Academic Evaluations

![10_Image_1.Png](10_Image_1.Png)

Academic evaluations typically come in many different forms, not only by using words like 'argue' or 'I argue that'. While reading the material in Part I of UEII, keep these points in mind.

## Concepts For Research

![13_Image_4.Png](13_Image_4.Png)

1. What does the concept of 'intelligence' comprise? Does it relate to capacity or processing speed? 

2. Has the human race evolved to be smarter? 

How does our genetic material evolve?

3. What is AI threshold? 4. What are universal machines? 5. What is narrow and broad intelligence? 6. What do you see in Hans Moravec's landscape of human competence?

Narrator begins: 'The true sign of intelligence is not 

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) knowledge but imagination.' as Albert Einstein once said. Welcome everyone, today, we're here to discuss a few interesting and thought-provoking topics. Let's get started.

Alternatively: We invite you all to participate, share your thoughts, and ask questions. Let's embark on this intellectual journey together."
Narrator ends: We can rage on with 

![14_image_1.png](14_image_1.png)

![14_image_2.png](14_image_2.png) these complex issues, but time forbids, so we must stop. Thank you, panel members.

What do you see in Hans Moravec's landscape 

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)

of human competence?

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

What's more intelligent: a computer program that can only play chess or one that can only play Go? There's no sensible answer to this, since they're good at different things that can't be directly compared. It also makes little sense to quibble about whether something is or isn't intelligent in borderline cases, since ability comes on a spectrum and isn't necessarily an all-or-nothing trait. Paraphrase: Tegmark (2017) suggests that it is ______________ to _________________________ the _____________________ levels of _______________________________________________ because / on the grounds that / __________________ 
- not sensible (adj.)
- intelligence levels
- different animals 
- because / on the grounds that
- vary in degrees 
(verb)
- isn't an either-or 
(adj.)
Teacher: 
Original text: The conventional wisdom among artificial intelligence researchers is that intelligence is ultimately all about information and computation, not about flesh, blood or carbon atoms. 

But what are information and computation really, given that physics has taught us that, at a fundamental level, everything is simply and energy moving around? How can something as abstract, intangible and ethereal as information and computation be embodied by tangible physical stuff? In particular, how can a bunch of dumb particles moving around according to the laws of physics exhibit behaviour that we'd call intelligent?

We like these sentences because they point to the crux of the issue: Is intelligence computation or neural firings in our brains. We like these sentences because they dispel the all-or-nothing nature of intelligence and express it well, although being a little informal.

Paraphrase:
As Tegmark (2017) _____________________________ that information and computation are like __________________________________________________________. How can such__________________________________manifest______________________ ___________________________ refer to as 'intelligence'?

## What Have You Learnt?

Even the genre called 'academic English' exhibits a wide 

![17_image_2.png](17_image_2.png) range of writing styles. Some authors prefer more succinct expression, while others adopt a more conversational style. Observe these variations as you progress through your 4year programme.

 *Evaluating and chunking sentences:* The following are some complex sentences 

![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)

expressing complex meanings. Together with your teacher, identify some more sentences from your readings and parse them.

## A Is B, Particularly, C, Wh- D

Following the example, please highlight the different parts in different colours.

AI is becoming a buzzword in many contexts around the world, in particular, in schools and higher institutions, where teaching and learning are increasingly digitized.

E.g.

It perhaps should be stressed again here that students should declare their how much they like fashion, particularly in this assignment, where the focus is on personal critical reflection.

1 2 The 'modern society' concept is in a state of flux, particularly in the last two years, when people are going to transition to a truly sustainable lifestyle. (Write a sentence with your peers.)

# "At The Heart Of": Getting Closer To Your Focus

Following this example, highlight the words that show you are getting closer AI approaches are not without (to emphasise there are) controversies and remain a contested territory of ethical consideration. At the heart of these contestations lies a critical question - (a dash is used to explain) will super AI systems ever take over human intelligence (Peeters et al., 2021).

E.g.

1 To a certain extent, glass can be reheated and reworked, but not without challenge. At the core of the skill is overheating the class to cause it to lose its shininess.

2 The artwork market is not without its critiques. At the heart of all great artwork is an idea - a unique concept which drives the artist to explore and delve into new territories. (Write a sentence with your peers.)

# The Benefits Of Using Quotes

Quotes are used to emphasise a point or *to express something through the mouth of someone else*. Acquiring this skill is important for your future studies.

An important quote for this literature review (Do not start with he/she says) is that of Harari (2017, p. 251): 
E.g.

"Until today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence". 

(This is a block quote, and in fact, your opinion. Using someone else's words makes it more credible and fairer.) Next, I examine culture, noting that there are a multitude of conceptions and definitions of that concept. Culture is "an encounter in an open landscape," as Tornberg (2000, p. 284) puts it.

1
(Is a whole sentence quoted here? What do you need to put when you insert a quote?) In reply to this question, James (1976) suggested that *when the object of thought* becomes part of conscious thought, it has been selected out of the stream of pure experience and is now a different, unique, and personal experience of the object:
'To be "conscious" means to have awareness of one's being added to that being; and this is just what happens when appropriative experience supervenes.' (p. 64)
(This is another block quote. What do you do with the quote? Do you just leave it there for your teacher to read?)

(Look for another quote and put it here.)

 UEII emphasises language editing skills, so what are your thoughts on writing poor sentences in literature reviews? Please listen to this phone-in program featuring callers discussing their concerns about bad grammar.

![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)

![22_image_2.png](22_image_2.png) afraid of academic writing.

So I've been asking about bad grammar. Does it wind you up? Now, let me tell you more about the story. This is in the mail this morning, but it's based on some research from University of Birmingham. So bad grammar is so annoying that it activates the fight or flight response within the human body according to this new research. So I'd like to know - we've had a few examples already. 

![22_image_3.png](22_image_3.png) What kind of bad grammar? What is it? Does it wind you up to the point? I mean I do notice it. So this is the report it says experts have discovered it really does cause a physical reaction, and even affects our heart rate. Instances of bad grammar include mixing up tenses within the sentence, confusing the singular and plural, using a double negative, or misusing a comma. Researchers from University of Birmingham recruited British English-speaking adults who listened to 40 English speech examples. So this is actually spoken grammar, half of which contained grammatical errors.

What is the host's attitude 

![22_image_4.png](22_image_4.png) towards bad grammar?

Caller One (first example) (lady) Hi, morning. Morning. Yes, it's true, when I do hear bad Grammar it makes me wince, but I usually have to control myself not to correct people, because that might sound a bit rude. Anyway, I have two examples. The first one is when people use the word 'invite', which is a verb as a noun, for example, 'Oh, I got an invite to the wedding.' instead of 'I got an invitation to the wedding'. But nobody says invitation anymore. Everybody says I got an 'invite' to…

![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)

![23_image_2.png](23_image_2.png)

Does caller one seem relaxed or 

![23_image_0.png](23_image_0.png)

![23_image_3.png](23_image_3.png) tense? What is her attitude?

Caller One (second example) The second one is the death of Present Continuous, which for example, 'I was stood at the station' instead of 'I was standing at the station'. What did you call that? The death of the Present Continuous. I like it. Tenses, now we're getting deep into grammar with tenses. Everybody says 'I was stood'. I said 'No, you weren't stood' - 'you were standing'. I was standing at the station. Yes. But everybody says 'I was stood'. (*Host:* I wouldn't say 'I was stood' but some people would. Is that maybe that is a dialect thing as well of…? I can imagine certain dialects would say 'I was stood at the station'. And that might be an excuse for that.)

# Low Do You Use The Language Editing Book?

![25_Image_2.Png](25_Image_2.Png)

1. Make use of the Language Editing book to learn about the common errors made by past students. If needed, seek clarification from your class teacher. However, do not expect the teacher to drill the items before your tests.

2. Ask yourself: What is the problem here? Why the changed parts are more effective?

3.  The Language editing book suggests certain ways to correct errors, but in actuality, there are many ways to express a message.
