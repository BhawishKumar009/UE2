How do you feel about meeting new people, seeing a new teacher, and exploring new academic topics? Do you feel anxious or excited?

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

If you have the slightest feeling of any of the fears, it is better to discuss them openly and look for solutions.

# Habits Of Mind…

Academic writing requires not only writing skills, but 

![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) also exploration, thinking and an audacious mindset; after that, you should feel 'I have succeeded'! The goal of this coursebook is to make you aware of the importance of conveying clear and lucid ideas that interest the reader. University English II achieves this through helping you learn about the current and evolving concepts that shape our society.

Let's explore the three gateways using the 6E framework.

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

## Theoretical Literature Review In Ueii?

A theoretical literature review provides an *overview of* 

![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png) current knowledge, *shares with the reader the results of* other studies, or provides a framework for *explaining the* importance of your essay or project. In University English II, a literature review is a piece of writing that allows you to examine Concepts of Change and theories, which set the context for discussing their effects on your discipline.

'Conduct your research' in this course means conducting research into Concepts of Change.

![9_image_2.png](9_image_2.png)

Gateway 1

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)

Human Intelligence in the Future World A Gateway introduces you to a series of readings, ideas and issues. This Gateway includes topics such as the nature of post-humanism, intelligence, and *cyborgs*. A significant part of university education, and what your teachers do in your department and faculty, is exploring the yet-to-be-fully-understood aspects of the world. 

Your teacher will only be able to guide you through a portion of these readings. You should not expect to receive all the explanations through the classroom activities. You may feel anxious when exploring a new topic, and we guarantee that this is normal.

Before you begin the tasks, you can FASTFORWARD to the EPILOGUE to have a glimpse at suggested writing topics.

 Attitude towards academic writing: This UEII student, Marcus, has stumbled onto 

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)

a somewhat exciting essay topic, Transhumanism. What is this topic about?

Suppose you are interested in the topic 'transhumanism' after reading the previous text, and you used ChatGPT to find out what it is. Here you have the answers. So what does ChatGPT tell you?

What are transhumanist theories in simple words?

Transhumanist theories are a set of ideas and beliefs that focus on using technology to enhance and improve human capabilities. The term
"transhumanism" refers to the idea of transcending or going beyond what is considered the normal human condition.

Transhumanists believe in the potential for technological advancements to enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. They advocate for the use of technologies like genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and biomedical enhancements to overcome the limitations of the human body and mind.

The goal of transhumanism is to improve human life and achieve a "posthuman" state, where humans have augmented capabilities that ss increased intelligence, extended lifespans, enhanced physical strength, and even the ability to merge with machines or upload consciousness.

In simple terms, transhumanist theories are about using technology to enhance human abilities and potentially achieve a state of being that goes beyond what is currently considered "normal" for humans. 10 Like SI Dislike

What are posthumanist theories in simple words?

Posthumanist theories are a set of ideas and perspectives that challenge traditional notions of what it means to be human. They explore the ways in which technology, culture, and other factors shape our understanding of human identity and relationships with the world.

Posthumanist theories question the idea that humans are separate and ssss interconnectedness of humans with animals, nature, and even machines. These theories encourage us to reconsider the boundaries between humans and non-humans, and to think about how our identities are shaped by social and cultural influences. Posthumanism also explores the potential for new forms of existence, such as cyborgs (part-human, part-machine beings) or artificial intelligence. It raises important ethical questions about the impact of these advancements on individuals and society.

In simple terms, posthumanist theories challenge traditional views of human nature and invite us to think more broadly about what it means to be human in a rapidly changing world.

Rather than improving our lives, science and technology today increasingly leave us debilitated and infantilised. It is time to restrain the runaway ambitions of technoscientific knowledge.

The idea of a 'cyborg' replaces the traditional views by Descartes about mind and body separation (Muri, 2007, p. 6). 

Technology blurs this distinction by integrating with both our physical bodies and our thinking processes. One example is the field of neuromorphic computing.

| While medical implants improve innate capabilities  to overcome illnesses, non-medical implants also  enhance innate capabilities, but they do not aim to  cure medical problems. Importantly, both types of  implants do not change a person's mental state,  consciousness, or perception; they simply boost  their inherent capabilities (Park 2014; Lai 2012;  Buchanan-Oliver and Cruz 2011; Christie and  Bloustien 2010). This raises a crucial question of  whether the cyborg evolution might redefine our  understanding of human medical anomalies and  therefore reshape drastically our societal norms of  human boundaries. | medical  implants Medical  anomalies |

intelligence (AI) and cyborgs transforms the human body into an information processing technology and turns it more computational and informatised. 

This revolution undermines the absolute human identity and enabling the vision of hybrid creatures, consisting of human and technological components at one.

optimistic Some well-known scientists worry about robots replacing humans, potentially causing massive unemployment. However, these concerns overlook the potential for humans to become superior cyborgs through body-enhancing technologies. 

Cyborgs could include individuals with massproduced implants, body hacks, or custom insideables.

 Let's read the example literature review and use the rubrics to understand it.

Activity 1.6 The purpose of this Literature review is to discuss the controversies surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it concludes with the author's opinions. AI is becoming a buzzword in many contexts around the world, in particular, in schools and higher institutions, where teaching and learning are increasingly digitized (Dator, 2020; Köstler & Ossewaarde, 2021). At the same time, the question of how AI intertwines with creativity is emerging (e.g., Rust & Huang, 2021). Here is a brief introduction to the background according to my review.

The field of AI has evolved from a small research project at Dartmouth College (US) in the 1950s to recent advances. As Creely (2022) outlined, AI has been applied to a dozen industries, including big data analytics, speech and facial recognition (e.g., Siri), and robotics, among others. Advances in machine learning and deep learning have facilitated AI's creative contributions to all aspects of life (Boden, 2018; Mitchell, 2019; Verma et al., 2021; Yi & Loia, 2019). However, neither being new nor effective alone is sufficient for AI to be referred to as intelligent. A compelling example is given by Cropley et al. (2022, p. 22), who illustrate this with an example: solving a parking issue by parking on the moon is novel but impractical. A creative product is novel, effective, and based on one's understanding of the world. According to Cropley et al., a product is creative when it is both novel and effective, and design must be based on one's knowledge of the world and sensibilities.

## Controversies Surrounding Artificial Intelligence

AI approaches, while innovative, are not exempt from ethical controversies. At the heart of these arguments lies a critical question - will super AI systems ever take over human intelligence (Peeters et al., 2021). I would like to introduce two prominent threads that underlie this debate. The first paragraph discusses the human-centric perspective of intelligence and creativity, and the next paragraph focuses on how AI creativity overturns our conception of consciousness. The first is about using the term 'intelligence' which is often used to frame the scope of AI innovation. In general, intelligence is the ability to successfully engage in the world, adapt to new situations, and solve theoretical and practical problems (Schlinger, 2003; Staats & Burns, 1981). There are three types of intelligence, according to Sternberg et al (2008): analytical, practical, and creative. Sternberg's theory emphasizes that intelligence is made up of humans' ability to perceive the world through senses and sensibilities. However, with AI, there is an underlying assumption that creativity is limited to computation and less emphasis on touchy perception. This view results in a narrow conception of creativity. The idea of AI creativity is challenged when the notion of consciousness comes into the picture. Consciousness, a topic debated across many disciplines, including brain science, and even ancient philosophers (Sattin et al., 2021), is hard to define or understand, despite its being present in biological beings, and particularly humans with larger brains (Shear, 1997). The aim of AI, particularly strong or super AI, is to create an independent, non-biological intelligence that incorporates consciousness. However, achieving this, especially without a clear understanding or agreed definition of consciousness, seems quite difficult (Li et al., 2021). The literature reviewed questions what remains of intelligence when it is intelligence without consciousness.

## Yet, More Problems Are Waiting To Be Solved

An important quote from Harari (2017, p. 251) states: 
"Until today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence".

Adapted from Creely Creely, E. (2022). Conceiving creativity and learning in a world of artificial intelligence: A thinking model. In D. 

Henriksen & P. Mishra (Eds.), Creative provocations: Speculations on the future of creativity, technology & 
learning (pp. 35-50). Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14549-0 This perspective is at odds with the new definitions of "creativity" and "consciousness" outlined above that AI creativity underpins. According to Tegmark (2017), this is Life 3.0, where non-biological intelligent life can think, create and be fully autonomous, existing on an equivalent level with biological life. By revisiting these notions, my literature review has led to a better understanding of how AI intelligence differs from our traditional understanding of intelligence. However, there is also a risk of disruption to what is considered to be a 'normal' learning process: As AI becomes more humanlike, teachers' role in influencing student creativity may shift as the machine becomes creative (see, Creely, 2022), and this could subvert the usual role of a teacher.

Using the rubrics to understand the Literature Review

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

Since a real literature review is not an assignment, it is not normally graded. Nevertheless, we will apply the Literature review draft assessment rubrics (Full mark: 100; A: 85/100) and understand how they function. In the following, use different parts of the rubrics to evaluate each paragraph.

Discuss with your classmates the effectiveness of each paragraph.

The purpose of this Literature review discuss the is to controversies surrounding Artificial Intelligence (ÁI) and it concludes with the author's opinions.

AI is becoming a buzzword in many contexts arofind the world, in particular, in schools and higher institutions/where teaching and learning are increasingly digitized (Dator, 2020; Köstler & Ossewaarde, 2021). At the same time, the question of how AI intertwines with creativity is emerging (e.g., Rust & Huang, 2021). Here is a brief introduction to the background according to my review.

## Teacher'S Comment:

As a reader, I am informed of the purpose.     Also,    
 I
aree that AI is becoming a buzzword. This idea resonates with mine.

Teacher's comment:
The generalisations and examples help me understand AI
as a field. 

 As readers, we learn something new as we read on.

Teacher's comment:
As readers, we feel that there ademic evaluation of the readings.  Adjectives and     coordinating conjunctions
'neither…nor' indicate       attitude and critical thinking.       Jargon terms are explained through an interesting example.

## Controversies Surrounding Artificial Intelligence,

![32_Image_2.Png](32_Image_2.Png)

AI approaches, while innovative, are not exempt from ethical controversies. At the heart of these arguments lies a critical question –
will super AI systems ever take over human intelligence (Peeters et al., 21). I would like to introduce two prominent threads that underlie this debate. The first paragraph discusses the human-centric perspective of intelligence and creativity, and the next paragraph focuses on how AI creativity overturns our conception of consciousness.

use The The of subheadings introduces themes focuses and discussion.

The writer presents his arguments in a way that leads us to understand       
the literature a systematic way.

Teacher's comment:
The first is about using the term 'intelligence' which is often used to frame the scope of AI innovation. In general, intelligence is the ability to successfully engage in the world, adapt to new situations, and solve theoretical and practical problems
(Schlinger, 2003; Staats & Burns, 1981). There are three types of intelligence, according to Sternberg et al. (2008): analytical, practical, and creative. Sternberg's theory emphasizes that intelligence is made up of humans' ability to perceive the world through senses and sensibilities. However, with AI, there is an underlying assumption that creativity is limited to computation and less emphasis on touchy perception. This view results in a nrrow conception of creativity.

The first 'what'? A bit unclear here. In general, the writer uses adjectives, nns, and noun phrases carefully.

There are a variety of sentence structures: declarative clauses (here is/are),

complex, embedded sentences (while) and parallel structures (to engage...adapt...

solve).
